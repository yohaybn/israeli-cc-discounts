## What this project is

Discount Finder aggregates discount and benefit offers from Israeli credit-card clubs and loyalty programs into one normalized dataset, served by a small FastAPI backend and a static web UI published from `docs/` via GitHub Pages.

Pipeline: source scrapers -> `main.py` (normalize, dedupe, merge) -> `data/discounts/*.json` + `docs/data/*.json` -> `scripts/join_businesses.py` (business matching) -> `api_server.py` / `docs/index.html`.

## Repository layout

- `*_scraper.py` - one module per source (MCC, HOT, HTzone, HVR, MAX gift cards, MAX benefits, BUYME, Discount Key, American Express).
- `main.py` - runs all scrapers, normalizes, dedupes, writes `data/discounts/` and `docs/data/`, keeps per-source metadata.
- `save_raw_scrapers.py` - saves raw source payloads under `data/raw/` for debugging (`--scrapers <name>` or `--all`).
- `scripts/join_businesses.py` - joins discounts with the business/branch dataset. Owner-run only (see below).
- `api_server.py` - FastAPI service over the generated data; `run_api.sh` starts it.
- `docs/` - static frontend (GitHub Pages). Data files it loads live in `docs/data/`.
- `tests/` - pytest suite with fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`; `tests/smoke_test.py` needs a running API.
- `run_daily.sh`, `scrape_and_sync.sh` - the owner's cron wrappers. Not for use in development.

## The shared schema

Every scraper returns a list of dicts with these fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `club` | string | Club/program name as shown to users (e.g. `MAX`, `מפתח דיסקונט`) |
| `business_name` | string | Business or offer title |
| `discount` | string | Human-readable discount text (plain text, no HTML) |
| `discount_url` | string | Canonical link to the offer |
| `discount_type` | enum | `billing_discount`, `rechargeable_card`, `voucher`, `gift_card`, `club_card` |
| `discount_value` | number \| null | Percent value when the discount is a parseable percent |
| `has_physical_store` | bool | `false` for online-only offers |
| `branches` | list | Branch objects when known, otherwise `[]` |
| `limitations` | string | Terms and conditions, plain text |
| `category` | string | Optional source category |

## Adding or changing a scraper

Conventions every source follows (see `amex_scraper.py` or `max_benefits_scraper.py` for a recent example):

1. One `scrape_<name>()` entry point returning normalized records; keep fetch, extract and normalize as separate functions so each is testable.
2. Wire it into `main.py`: run it, write `data/discounts/<name>_discounts.json` only on a non-empty result, record `metadata["<name>"]`, and on failure fall back to the previous file (last-good-data behavior). Never delete or empty an existing data file because one run failed.
3. Add a `save_<name>_raw()` function to `save_raw_scrapers.py` and register it in the `--all` list, the `--scrapers` help text and the dispatch block.
4. Add real (trimmed) fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` and pytest tests that run fully offline: normalization, dedupe, edge cases (expired/out-of-stock/malformed), and a mocked network walk. Live-network checks are manual, not part of the test suite.
5. Document the source in `README.md` (one section per source, including the raw-capture command).

## Hard rules

- Public data only. Never bypass logins, OTP, CAPTCHAs, Cloudflare or any other access control. If a source starts blocking, stop and report - do not work around it.
- Never commit generated data: no `data/` or `docs/data/` changes from local runs in a PR. Data regeneration and `scripts/join_businesses.py` are run by the repo owner on request, not as part of code PRs.
- One concern per PR, based on the latest `main`. Leave PRs open for the owner's manual review; do not merge or enable auto-merge.
- Do not modify the cron wrappers (`run_daily.sh`, `scrape_and_sync.sh`) to point at your environment; they contain the owner's server paths.

## Checks before opening a PR

```bash
python -m pytest -q tests/            # unit tests (offline)
python -m compileall -q <changed .py files>
git diff --check                      # whitespace/errors
```

Then run one live scrape of the changed source and confirm the normalized record count looks sane. Note the count in the PR description.

The whole suite should pass on a clean checkout. Tests that read generated data (`data/discounts/`) skip when it is missing; the dedupe check falls back to the committed `docs/data/all_combined_discounts.json`.
